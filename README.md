In your WordPress admin console, upload and activate the plugin under: Plugins -> Add New -> Upload 

Usage

Once installed and activated, click on the Amazon Pay menu item in the left-hand navigation of your WordPress admin. 

Set up your Amazon Pay account keys and save the changes. You can register [here](https://payments.amazon.com/register?source=SPPD&ld=APUSWORDPRESS&spId=A3D68VL23XMOV2&locale=US) if you don't have a merchant account.
